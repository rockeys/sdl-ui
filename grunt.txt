Command for install grunt
-------------------------
Assuming you already have Node, Grunt and Bower installed: (install by cmd)
clone the project, cd to directory
step 1: git clone (https path from github.com) 
step 2: npm install -g grunt-cli
step 3: npm install
step 4: npm install -g bower
step 5: bower install
step 6: grunt init (initial compile)
step 7: grunt (to watch for changes and serve the dev folder on http://localhost:3000)

Final: grunt build - for build the project


Grunt tasks
-----------
grunt init - run this the first time you check out the project. Compiles SASS, wires up any bower dependencies and builds your icons for the first time
grunt - (default task) runs a watch and Node server task concurrently. Dev folder can be browsed at http://localhost:3000
grunt build - Will run the build task into the build folder
grunt serve - Will serve up the build folder for you to preview
grunt serve:dev - Serves up the dev folder, without running "watch"
grunt svg_icons - Run the SVG icon task chain on it's own
grunt clean:temp - Remove the temp directory via Grunt. Although rm -fr .tmp is quicker
grunt clean:build - As above but for the build folder. Because the build task updates, rather than replaces files (for speed), you'll need this first if you want to start fresh.
